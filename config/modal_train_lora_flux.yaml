          - "Instyle of 4lv4, A surreal image shows a large cartoonish figure stepping over an urban street. The figure wears a pink hat, a striped shirt, blue pants, pink shoes. The figure has an extended arm as if taking a selfie. The background shows classic buildings on a cobblestone road. The sky is a clear blue, suggesting daylight. The image has a whimsical, playful tone. The perspective is low, emphasizing the size of the figure."
          - "In style of 4lv4, The image depicts an urban scene featuring a giant, stylized woman in a red suit holding a laptop. She is overlaid on a street with tall buildings and a neoclassical building with columns. The woman is cartoonish with simple, flat features, while the buildings are realistically rendered, creating a stark juxtaposition.  The background includes pedestrians and city structures, and the lighting appears to be daylight. The mood is surreal and whimsical due to the contrast in size and style between the figure and the buildings."
          - "Instyle of 4lv4, The image shows a stylized, large figure integrated into an urban scene. The cartoon-like figure, with a pink top and large brown hands, appears to interact with the buildings. The figureâ€™s hand is raised towards the sky, its lines and soft edges juxtaposed against the hard lines of the skyscrapers. The city buildings are tall and grey, with geometric shapes, under a cloudy sky. The perspective is low-angle, emphasizing the size of both the buildings and the figure. The overall atmosphere is playful and surreal, blending fantasy with reality."
